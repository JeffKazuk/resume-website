Dear William Lazarko,

I am writing to express my interest in the Operational Support - Service Desk position within the Dufresne Group, as advertised. With a rich background in the world of film and video production, I am eager to transition my passion for technology into the dynamic realm of IT.

Earlier in my career, I applied my technical expertise to establish and troubleshoot hardware-related issues as a technical associate at Staples. I redirected my attention towards film and video production, captivated by the technology integral to that field. While immersed in these roles, I consistently honed my IT skills. Now, driven by my interest in technology, I am seeking to transition back into the realm of IT support.

I am drawn to the opportunity at the Dufresne Group to leverage my technical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction. I am eager to embark on a new journey where I can contribute my passion for technology to assisting your team in accomplishing the goals of the business.

I am enthusiastic about the chance to discuss how my unique blend of skills and experiences aligns with the needs of the Dufresne Group. I look forward to the potential opportunity to work with you once again, as your mentorship at Staples was invaluable to me. Thank you for considering my application, I am available at your earliest convenience for an interview.

Warm regards,

Jeff Kazuk
